# BASIC TYPES

For programs to be useful, we need to be able to work with some of the simplest units of data: numbers, strings, structures, boolean values, and the like. In TypeScript, we support much the same types as you would expect in JavaScript, with a convenient enumeration type thrown in to help things along.

The most basic datatype is the simple true/false value, which JavaScript and TypeScript call a `boolean` value.

```typescript
let isDone: boolean = false;
```

# EXERCISE

Create a boolean variable `isLearning` and set its value to `true`.

## HINTS

To create a TypeScript file, create a new file with a `.ts` extension. When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ typescripting verify script.ts
```

to proceed. Your script will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
